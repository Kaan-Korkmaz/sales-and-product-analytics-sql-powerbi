# Sales Analytics Project (SQL)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end sales analytics workflow using
SQL.\
The analysis covers data profiling, cleaning, exploratory analysis, KPI
generation, time-based trends, segmentation, and the creation of
reporting-ready views.

The main objective is to show how raw transactional data can be
transformed into meaningful business insights and reusable reporting
layers using SQL only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Model

The dataset follows a simple analytical structure with one fact table
and two dimension tables:

-   **fact_sales**
    -   order_number
    -   order_date
    -   sales_amount
    -   quantity
-   **dim_customers**
    -   customer_key
    -   customer_number
    -   first_name, last_name
    -   gender
    -   country
    -   birthdate
-   **dim_products**
    -   product_key
    -   product_name
    -   category
    -   subcategory
    -   cost

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Preparation

Before analysis, several data quality checks and transformations are
applied:

-   Inspection of table schemas and data types
-   Cleaning empty string values in date fields
-   Converting text-based date columns into proper `DATE` types
-   Defining the valid sales date range
-   Calculating customer age boundaries

These steps ensure consistency and reliability across all analyses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Analyses

### 1. Global KPIs

High-level business metrics are calculated, including: - Total sales -
Total quantity sold - Total number of orders - Total number of
products - Total number of customers

A unified KPI output is created using `UNION ALL` to support
executive-style reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Customer Analysis

Customer-focused insights include: - Customer distribution by country
and gender - Total revenue generated by each customer - Identification
of top customers by revenue - Identification of customers with the
fewest orders - Customer lifecycle analysis using first and last order
dates

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Product & Category Analysis

Product-level performance is analyzed through: - Product counts by
category - Average product cost by category - Revenue contribution by
category - Top and bottom performing products - Best and worst
performing subcategories

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Time Series & Seasonality

Sales trends over time are explored using: - Monthly sales aggregation -
Monthly customer counts - Alternative year--month grouping approaches -
Identification of seasonal patterns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Cumulative & Growth Analysis

To evaluate overall business performance: - Running total of monthly
sales - Moving average price calculations - Trend-based indicators to
understand growth or decline

Window functions are heavily used in this section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Performance Benchmarking

Product performance is benchmarked by: - Yearly sales per product -
Comparison against historical product averages - Year-over-year change
analysis using `LAG` - Classification of performance changes (Increase /
Decrease / No Change)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Segmentation

**Product Segmentation** - Products grouped into cost ranges to
understand pricing distribution

**Customer Segmentation** - **VIP**: Customers with at least 12 months
of history and high total spending - **Regular**: Customers with at
least 12 months of history and lower spending - **New**: Customers with
a lifespan under 12 months

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reporting Layer

The final step of the project is the creation of reporting views
designed for BI consumption:

-   **report_customers**
    -   Customer-level KPIs
    -   Age range, customer status, recency
    -   Average order value and average monthly spend
-   **report_products**
    -   Product lifecycle metrics
    -   Performance classification
    -   Average selling price
    -   Revenue and order-based KPIs

These views are designed to be directly connected to BI tools such as
Power BI or Tableau.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated

-   Data cleaning and type conversion
-   Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
-   Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`, running totals)
-   Time-series analysis
-   Business-oriented KPI design
-   Data segmentation
-   Reporting-ready SQL views

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

This project focuses purely on SQL-based analytics and transformation
logic.\
Visualization and dashboard creation are intentionally excluded to keep
the scope centered on data analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was provided by **Data with Baraa**
for educational and portfolio purposes.

All data modeling, analytical logic, and Power BI
visualizations were designed and implemented independently as part of
this project.
